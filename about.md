I love designing and building web and backend applications, leveraging devops principles, cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services, and solid software engineering practices. I have experience leading development and engineering teams to building great applications for complex problems. Projects I've worked on include leading teams in developing serverless API backends, modern database applications, data migrations, and well architected cloud based solutions. Let's get started solving difficult problems together!
